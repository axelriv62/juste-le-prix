## Presentation  

This application was developed as part of the third semester of the BUT in Computer Science at the IUT of Lens

The main objective was to create a *Juste le Prix* (The Price Is Right) game using Flask, while managing the project with Git and following the Scrum methodology.  

<br>  

## Objectives  

- Integrate a database to store products and game logs.  
- Retrieve product information from Amazon using an API.  
- Create a user-friendly interface for playing and managing the game.  
- Implement diverse features to make the game more engaging.  

<br>  

## Features  

- Light/Dark mode  
- Home page  
- Product insertion page  
- Score display page  
- Product themes  
- Sound effects  

<br>  

## Areas for Improvement  

Although the project is complete for coursework purposes, there are still areas for improvement:  

- Add a timer for each game.  
- Implement difficulty levels.  
- Integrate a sorting system for the score display.
